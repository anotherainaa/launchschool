console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world!';

// This will log undefined.

// All variables in JS declared with `var` are hoisted, 
// they are virutallly moved to the beginning of the scope. 

// When a `var` variable is declared but not assigned a value, 
// it is initialized to the value `undefined`.
// For this reason, the code logs `undefined`.
