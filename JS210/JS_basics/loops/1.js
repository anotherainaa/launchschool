// Add code to log the current value of i. 
// What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged? 


for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i)
}

// I'm expected numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to be logger. 
// JS's for loop expects an initializer, a condition and incrementor as coded up on lin5. 
// In the initializer we can tell the `i` is being intialized with a starting value of 0. 
// In the condition, the loop will run until `i` is equal to 10 (10 included.)
// In the incrementor, we can tell that `i` will increment by 2 each time. 
// Hence, the resulting output will be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 respectievly.
