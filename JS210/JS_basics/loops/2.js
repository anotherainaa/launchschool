// Modify the code to log numbers from 10 to 1 instead, and then lo `Launch!`

for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i -= 1) {

// Here, we change the initial expression to initialize i = 10. 
// The condition also needs to be changed such that it will continue running as long as i
// is greater than 1 
// Then, we change the increment expression to `i -= 1` so that the number going in a decresing order 
// Finally we make sure we add `console.log('Launch!')` to meet the instructions.
