=begin

# What can we see?
. johns_postal_service is an instance of class PostalService
. PostalService deos not have #send method, the Mailing class does.
. Instead it invokes the send method from parent class `Object`?

# What can be done?
. Assuming that Postal Service should have access to Mailing methods,
. we can include Mailing into PostalService class.
. Now , we can call #send that is inherited from the Mailing module.

# Problem
. We should not overwrite the original #send method.
  . To fix this, we can rename `send` method to `send_mail` instead.

# LS Notes
. keyword: accidental method overwriting.
. question: why does Ruby not complaint that there is no method `send`?
  . Ruby looks for `sen` on the method lookup path,
  . and it finds the method with this name in the `Object` class.
  . so it calls `Object#send` method, which expects a method name as the arg.
  . The argument provided is not the name of any method, we get an error.
