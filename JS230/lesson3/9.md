# Example: Loading HTML via XHR

Code example: An existing page on a webstore. 
```js
<h1>Existing Page<h1>

<div id='store'><div>
```

We're going to use the JS below to fetch the list of products from a web store and insert it in the `div` with `id` of `store`

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  let request = new XMLHTTPRequest();
  request.open('GET', 'https://ls-230-web-store-demo.herokuapp.com/products');

  request.addEventListener('load', event => {
    let store = document.getElementById('store');
    store.innerHTML = request.response;
  });

  request.send();
})
```

What is happening? 
- When the DOM loads, JS will run the `DOMContentLoaded` handler
- This handler makes a request to the URL `https://ls-230-web-store-demo.herokuapp.com/products.`
- When the request finishes loading, the `load` handler stores the response body inside the `<div id="store"> ` tag.

What happens when we try to click the links on the products? 
- where do the links come from (probably from the response itself) 
- we get 404 

How can we handle th 404? 
- we need to add an event handler that listens for clicks within the embedded content. 

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  let store = document.getElementById('store');

  let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', 'https://ls-230-web-store-demo.herokuapp.com/products');

  document.addEventListener('load', event => store.innerhtml = request.response);
  request.send();

  document.addEventListener('click', event => {
    let target = event.target;

    if (target.tagName !== 'A') {
      return;
    }

    event.preventDefault();

    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open('GET', 'https://ls-230-web-store-demo.herokuapp.com' + target.getAttribute('href')); // to open the link of each URL 
    
    request.addEventListener('load', event => store.innerHTML = request.response);
    request.send();
  })
})
```
What are we trying to do with this code? 
- We want to make sure that we display the contents of clicking on the link of each product
- We use AJAX to prevent the default behaviour of opening the page
- Instead we grab the content and then update the `store` to contain that data.
- I think the reason that it displays HTML is because the response itself is HTML. Therefore, we don't need to create it.

What two concepts did we learn here? 
- we can use an `XMLHttpRequest` object to fetch content and insert it in an existing web page without a full page reload. 
- we can attach event listeners to content embedded in the page to circumvent the browser's default behavior and create custom interactions.

## Problems

- We don't have any code to send any data to the server? 
- We also don't have any code to handle the response from the server? 
- Therefore, the default behavior is executed
  - it tries to send a `POST` request to `http://s.codepen.io/products/1` and receives a 404 resonse.
