# Example: Submitting a Form via XHR

What are the 3 steps to submitting a form using JS?
- Serialize the form data
- Send the request using `XMLHttpRequest`
- Handle the response

Code for making POST request
```javascript
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('POST', 'https://example.test/path');

let data = 'this is a test';
request.send(data);

// or if there was not data to send
// request.send();
```

The HTTP request looks like this
```
POST /path HTTP/1.1
Host: example.test
Content-Length: 14
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*

this is a test
```

Blue box note about `Accept` header
- it gets set to `*/*` if it isn't set via `setRequestHeader` 

What's the difference to GET requests? 
- We add data in the request body by passing it to `send` 
- What does this mean? >> it takes us back to step one, where we have to serialize the form data.

## URL-encoding POST Parameters

What must the content-type be? What are the steps to using this form of data serialization
- `application/x-www-formurlencoded` 
- we place the encoded name-value string in the request body

Code eaxmple
```javascript
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('POST', 'https://ls-230-book-catalog.herokuapp.com/books');

request.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

let data = 'title=Effective%20JavaScript&author=David%20Herman';

request.addEventListener('load', () => {
  if (request.status === 201) {
    console.log(`This book was added to the catalog: ${request.responseText}`);
  }
});

request.send(data);
```

What is the HTTP Request that is created 
```
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: ls-230-book-catalog.herokuapp.com
Content-Length: 50
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*

'title=Effective%20JavaScript&author=David%20Herman'
```

The server parses the data in the HTTP request's body and makes it available in the following data structure. 
```
{
  title: 'Effective JavaScript',
  author: 'David Herman'
}
```

The example data structure assumes that the data is already in a valid URL-safe format. 

Why is this important? 
- most of the time, we need to construct this data on the fly based on the state of the program
- or more often, values entered by a user in an HTML form (we need to make sure the input is valid URL-safe format)

## Submitting a form 

```html
<form id="form">
  <p><label>Title: <input type="text" name="title"></label></p>
  <p><label>Author: <input type="text" name="author"></label></p>
  <p><button type="submit">Submit</button></p>
</form>
```

- Here, we can use the `HTMLFormElement.elements` property to help serialize the form data.
- We're doing this in comparison to the previous example, where we provide the data explicitly in our code. 
- In this case, the data is provided by the user through the HTML form. We use the same data to show comparison between the two.

```javascript
let form = document.getElementById('form');

form.addEventListener('submit', event => {
  event.preventDefault();

  // access the inputs using form.elements and serialize into a string
  let keysAndValues = [];

  for (let index = 0; index < form.elements.length; index += 1) {
    let element = form.elements[index];
    let key;
    let value;

    if (element.type !== 'submit') {
      key = encodeURIComponent(element.name);
      value = encdeURIComponent(element.value);
      keysAndValues.push(`${key}=${value}`);
    }
  }

  let data = keysAndValues.join('&');

  // submit the data
  let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('POST', 'https://ls-230-book-catalog.herokuapp.com/books');
  request.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

  request.addEventListener('load', ()=> {
    if (request.status === 201) {
      console.log(`This book was added to the catalog: ${request.responseText}`);
    }
  });

  request.send(data);
})
```

When the code runs, it sends a request that is identical to the one we sent in the previous example.

## Submitting a Form with FormData

Why?
- the process we did above is a manual and error-prone process. 

What's the solution?
- Modern browsers provide a built-in API to assist in this process.
- `FormData` - only uses input fields that have a `name` attribute.

Code example using `FormData`
```javascript
let form = document.getElementById('form');

form.addEventListener('submit', event => {
  // prevent the browser from submitting the form
  event.preventDefault();

  let data = new FormData(form);

  let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('POST', 'https://ls-230-book-catalog.herokuapp.com/books');

  request.addEventListener('load', () => {
    if (request.status === 201) {
      console.log(`This book was added to the catalog: ${request.responseText}`);
    }
  });

  request.send(data);
});
```

What's the difference between manually parsing the data? 
- `FormData` seems to take care of everything.

What is the caveat of using `FormData`? What's different? 
- It uses a data serialization format called _multipart_

What about thie _multipart_ format?
- forms that include file inputs use this same serialization
- `FormData` can upload files, it makes sense for it to default to this multipart format

What does the request look like? 
```
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: ls-230-book-catalog.herokuapp.com
Content-Length: 234
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryf0PCniJK0bw0lb4e
Accept: */*

------WebKitFormBoundaryf0PCniJK0bw0lb4e
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

Effective JavaScript
------WebKitFormBoundaryf0PCniJK0bw0lb4e
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="author"

David Herman
------WebKitFormBoundaryf0PCniJK0bw0lb4e--
```
- note the difference in the content type
- note the difference in the body

Each section is prefixed by a string (in this case `------WebKitFormBoundaryf0PCniJK0bw0lb4e)`)
- it includes a HTTP header called `Content-Disposition` that provides the name of a parameter and it's value. 



Why do we need to authenticate a POST request?

How can we authenticate a POST request?
- provide a special header that contains an authentication token (only an authorized client should know)
How does this work in a real application?
- User has to login to a site, the site would return a unique token, possible via a cookie
- (Or developer has to login to a site, get an authentication token, send that with the request)
