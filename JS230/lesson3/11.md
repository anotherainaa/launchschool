# Example: Loading JSON via XHR

What have we learned up til now? 
- How to retrieve HTML fragments from a server and insert them into a page.

This approach works well for __________. 
- server-side rendering to generate the user interface. (The server provides the HTML?)

What is the alternative? 
- client-side rendering using client-side code. 

When does this technique make sense? 
- The use interface has widgets that the server doesn't render.

A code example from a previous assignment.
```javascript
let request  = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails');

request.addEventListener('load', event => {
  let data = JSON.parse(request.response);

  // do something with data
})

request.send();
```

Why is this process easier in modern browsers? 
- Because they provide native support for fetching JSON data.
- We can take advantage of `responseType` property to tell the browser how to handle the data it receives. 

What are valid values for `responseType`?
- `text`
- `json`
- `arraybuffer`
- `blob`
- `document`

How can we change the code we had before? 

Here is code using `responseType` by setting it on the request after opening it. 
```javascript
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails');
request.responseType = 'json';

request.addEventListener('load', event => {
  let data = request.response; // Notice how we don't have to parse the response anymore?
})

request.send();
```
What's different than before? 
- We don't have to explicitly parse the response using `JSON.parse`
- The data is already parsed into JSON, or it will return null if the body couldn't be parsed or another error occured. 
- we can avoid extra error handling code. 

Example of how we may want to handle errors with JSON response which is avoided using `resposeType`
```javascript
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails');

request.addEventListener('load', event => {
  try {
    let data = JSON.parse(request.response);
  } catch(e) {
    console.log('Cannot parse the received response ad JSON.')
  }
});

request.send();
```

- We avoid this completely by setting `responseType` to `json`.
- The response will either contain a value or it doesn't. (and we can check for that condition)

### Problem

Question 1

```javascript
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails');
request.responseType = 'json';

request.addEventListener('load', event => {
  let data = request.response;
  console.log(request.status);
  console.log(data.open_issues);
});

request.send();
```

Question 2
```javascript
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'htps://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails');
request.responseType = 'json';

request.addEventListener('load', event => {
  let data = request.response;
  console.log(request.status);
  console.log(data.open_issues);
});

request.addEventListener('error', event => {
  console.log('The request could not be completed!')
});

request.send();
```
