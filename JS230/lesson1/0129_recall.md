What did I learn from the quiz? 
- `nodeValue` returns `null` for elements. 
- Will return the text content for text nodes. 
- w3c will complaint if we make a deep clone of a node which contains an ID which then makes that ID no longer unique. 
- `textContent` has a gotcha. Which is it will concatenate all the text content, remove the tags within them and also concatenate the whitespaces which we can handle with regex. (Tags disappearing being problematic).
- We have a thing called live collection. 
- The difference between node properties VS element properties. 
- The difference between node properties to traverse the DOM vs element properties that traverse the DOM. 
- What is at the top of the DOM tree. 
- `nodeType` returns a number that represents that node type.
- We can use `console.dir` to check details about what a node is. 
- That we can traverse the DOM tree in any direction so long as we have a starting point.
