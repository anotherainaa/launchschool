Mental Model on how browser renders a web page. 

1. HTML code received from the server. 
1. HTML parsed and JavaScript evaluated. 
1. DOM constructed from parsed HTML. 
1. `DOMContentLoaded` event fires on document (the DOM object). 
1. Page displayed on screen. 
1. Embedded assets are loaded. 
1. `load` event fires on `window`. 

Questions
- What is the `load` event here? 
  - According to material, this is useless because it is called much later when EVERYTHING is loadded. 
  - Is it automatically run? 
- Note that `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired before the page is displayed on screen and embedded assets are loaded. 
  - At this point in time, we can use JS to manipulate the DOM.
