What is happening? 

Step 1
- The browser loads the age and evaluates the JS within the script tag. 
- This code registers a callback to handle the `DOMContentLoaded` event when it fires on `document`. 

Step 2
- The browser waits for event to fire. (Specifically we are waiting for the `DOMContentLoaded` to be fired)

Step 3
- The browser fully loads the HTML, builds the DOM
- The browser fires the `DOMContentLoaded` event on `document`. (as defined by the script)

Step 4
- The browser invokes the event handler for `DOMContentLoaded` (the second argument?), 
- which uses `document.getElementById` to get references to two DOM elements
- and initialized the variable `count`. 
- It also registers an event listener for `click` events on addButton. 

(Whenever we use `addEventListener` we are registering and event listener)
(The event that we're listening for depends on the arguments? e.g 'click', 'key' etc)

Step 5
- The browser waits for an event to fire (specifically, we are waiting for the button to be clicked.)

Step 6
- When the user clicks on button, 
  - the click event fires and the browser runs the handler (the argument passed into `addEventListener`)
- The callback increments the value of `count` and updates the `textContent` of the `#output` `span`.

Step 7
- The browser waits for an event to fire. 

(An event firing means, an event is "triggered" or "done by someone" on something that the application is set to listen to)
(An event handler is what the browser will invoke when the event fires.)
