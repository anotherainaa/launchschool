# Including an External Library

What are the different ways that we can do so? 
- Hosting the files locally
- using a CDN

Common way to organize libraries locally
- keep in a separate directory within JS directory. 
- we'll also need a `script` tag to reference the locally hosted library

What is a CDN? 
- libraries that are hosted by jQuery or google
- we can then reference them using the `src` attribute in the `<script>` tag.
- usually get a choice of versions, and whether to use compressed and minified files or not


## Order is Important

- Place the script tag for the library before any script tags where that library is used. 
- e.g `jQuery` before our own script.
