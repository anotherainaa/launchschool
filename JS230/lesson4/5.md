# jQuery

What is jQuery? 
- library that provides a convenient API to manipulate elements, handle events and make AJAX request

Why was jQuery created and became popular? 
- because of cross-browser support amidst lack of standardization during the browser wars
- created an abstraction layer that took care of all the workarounds

Why have jQuery usage dwindled down?
- Browser compatibility and standardization issues has improved
- many things can be donw using vanillaJS easily

Where is it still used? 
- in applications that need to support older browser
- in frameworks and plug-ins that still have jQuery as a dependency

Is jQuery a separate language from JS? 
- No, it's not.
- it's a library of functions and methods that abstract away JS functionality

Important point!
- try to relate it's functionality back to the concepts we covered in earlier lessons.
- think about how we can accomplish the same functionality without jQuery, and how that would make the code different

## jQuery Function

At it's core
- jQuery is a function that wraps a collection of DOM elements and some convenience methods into an object. 
- can call the function to select the element you need to process
- and manipulate the object or its elements with methods built into the object

What is it? - A function that works with an argument that you pass to it
- if the argument is a string or a DOM element, it wraps a collection of jQuery objects and returns them
- if the argument is a function, jQuery uses that function as a callback when the document is ready. 

common practice to use `$` sign alias for `jQuery`object 

example code
```javascript
var $content = jQuery('#content'); 
var $sameContent = $('#content');
```
Here we are using the Airbnb-recommended style of prefixing names with `$` so that we can instantly distingush them from non-jQuery objects. 

### Collections

return value of jQuery is a collection. 
```javascript
var $lis = $('li');
var $id = $('#someID')
$lis.length // => 3
``` 
even when we use an ID selector - both return collections but it may contain only one item
- id should only return one item anyway

We can check the length property to see how many elements are selected.

- In this case it's kind of like using `document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)`
- Note that `document.getElementById(id)` returns a node that is not in a collection

What is the jQuery property, what does it return and what is it used for? 
- use it on an object, it would return the version of jQuery used if the object is a jQuery object
- use it to check if something is a jQuery object
- `$content.jquery`

# The DOM ready callback 

What it looks like? 
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  // DOM loaded and ready, referenced image on img tags are not ready
});
```


Why do we need it? 
- Because jQuery code acts on DOM elements. 

Caveats to node? 
- `ready` doesn't wait for the browser to load images via `img` tags

What if you have to wait until the window finishes loading? 
```javascript
$(window).load(function() {
  // DOM loaded and ready, referenced image on img tags loaded and ready
});
```

What is a shorter way to write the code? 
```javascript
$(function() {
  // DOM is now loaded
})
```

## jQuery Object methods

What can we do with a JQuery object? 
- many things for example, change the `font-size` for all the elements represent by the object with the `css` method

```javascript
$content.css('font-size', '18px ');
```
