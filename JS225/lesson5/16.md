# Modules

What's the benefit of modules? 
- Organizing large code base - split the program into modules
- encapsulation - good for managing private data

## Common JS Modules

Example of a module we've used: 
- readline sync

```jsx
const readline = require('readline-sync');
let choice = readline.question('Do you want to run this program? (y/n)')
```
â€» Can't be used on browser because node modules are syncrhonously loaded, would be too slow

- We can't use Node modules in the browser
  - but we can use transpiler like `Babel` to use it on the browser

## Creating commonJS modules

See `logit.js` and `main.js` files on how to export the functions in a module from one file, and then import it on another.

## CommonJS variables

- In Node, all code is part of CommonJS Module
- Each module provides these variables
  - `module` - object that represent the current module
  - `exports` - the name(s) exported by the module
  - `require(moduleName)` - function that loads a module
  - `__dirname` - absolute pathname of directory
  - `__filename` - absolute pathname of the file that contains module

# JS Modules

- lack of modules wasn't a problem before, because JS programs were minimal
- now, JS manages almost entire pages of many apps (Google Docs is almost entirely JS)

- What happens when you require a module? 
  - Node stops what it's doing and loads the inidicated module into memory (works fine locally)
- What happens if we do the same in a browser? 
  - browser need to request for the resource
  - wait for server's response
  - convert the response into something it can use
  - then load the module
  - and the browser can't do anything else while it's doing this
  - (synchronous approach is too slow for the browser)

What ways to work around? 
- RequireJS - lets us download a bunch of modules asynchoronously, but must download RequireJS code first
- Browserify - run this program to build a single large JS file that contain all of the modules which the browser can then download. 
- Other tools also exists - but developers have to learn to use them.

Es6 supports modules natively
- `export` and `import` keywords added to the language and modern browser now support them
- for older browsers, use 
  - `Babel` - translates ES6 code to ES5
  - `Webpack` - consolidates all of the modules needed into a single file
